# Python-School-Project

This project consists of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a bank transactions dataset with labels of "1" for fraud and "0" for non-fraud.
We apply three Machine Learning algorithms ( Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree).
And finally we evaluate these models in terms of accuracy, f1-score and other performance mesures.

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle Website and it has a total of 284,807 transactions, and can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud "Dataset download link").
