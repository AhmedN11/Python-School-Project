######### Python-School-Project

This project consists of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a bank transactions dataset with labels of "1" for fraud and "0" for non-fraud.
We apply three Machine Learning algorithms ( Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree).
And finally we evaluate these models in terms of accuracy, f1-score and other performance mesures.
